## Case Study

# [Vanguard’s global multi-region approach](https://medium.com/vanguard-technology/vanguards-global-multi-region-approach-c7bb22e7317a)

Many organizations see multi-region simply as a resiliency initiative. With multiple investment sites accessing the same US-based system, network latency and bandwidth have a significant impact on user experience. GIFS initially saw multi-region as a means to improve our user experience and only later as a means to increase our availability.

“Big design up front is dumb. Doing no design up front is even dumber.” This quote epitomises what I’ve seen during our journey from “big design up front” in the 20th century, to “emergent design” and “evolutionary architecture” in the 21st. In their desire to become “agile”, many teams seem to have abandoned architectural thinking, upfront design, documentation, diagramming, and modelling.

# Microservices

# [Should That Be a Microservice? Keep These Six Factors in Mind](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/should-that-be-a-microservice-keep-these-six-factors-in-mind)

Do parts of your system need to evolve at different speeds or in different directions? If so, separate them into microservices. This allows each component to have independent lifecycles.

In any system, some modules are hardly touched, while others seem to change every iteration.

TheFork’s purpose is to provide the right dining experience for the right occasion, around the table, making diners happy and pulling restaurants toward success. However, the way to get things achieved matters — the Product does matter. For instance, the process to design and deliver values through our digital product must have a higher built-in quality.

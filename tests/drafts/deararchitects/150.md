## Case Study

# [Why We Killed Our End-to-End Test Suite](https://building.nubank.com.br/why-we-killed-our-end-to-end-test-suite/)

Our End-to-End test suite complemented our testing strategy to assure our systems were of very high quality and integrity.

It turns out that this practice has a lot of downsides. In my early days working here I conducted an assessment of engineering pain points. Speaking to many different people and teams, the struggle with this type of test became a common theme.[![](https://mcusercontent.com/219daa24bb0e9b48aea4bcfcf/images/dcaed9ab-f003-68b5-f395-306c5c68eee7.jpeg)](https://aws.plainenglish.io/serverless-monitoring-best-practices-fbcf14e3b624 "")

To create an effective monitoring strategy, define clear objectives and metrics. This involves identifying specific outcomes you want to achieve. Maintaining a clear roadmap helps you decide the information and metrics required to reach your goals before implementing the monitoring strategy.

The business architecture domain within enterprise architecture is not just about business capabilities and business processes. It is foremost about optimizing value for your customers and contributing to building a more customer-driven organization.

# Event-Driven Architecture

# [A Case for Event-Driven Architecture with Mediator Topology](https://www.infoq.com/articles/eda-mediator)

Today, I want to share a story about a business case where we used Event-Driven Architecture with Mediator topology and some interesting implementation details, such as elastic scalability, reliability, and durable workflows. All were built using Kubernetes, KEDA, AWS, and .NET technologies.

The problem is we are not used to testing architecture — just code. It’s non-trivial for most organizations to succinctly define what they want their software to do — knowing what it should do and then actually making that happen. You can express this in many ways, short and sweet or book-length, but that struggle is what I believe is the simple truth at the center of many of our professional lives.

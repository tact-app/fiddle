# [Decentralizing the Practice of Architecture at Xapo Bank](https://martinfowler.com/articles/xapo-architecture-experience.html)

Xapo was founded as a Bitcoin service provider and developed into an online bank. During this transition it needed to reassess its software estate and establish an architecture capability to guide its future. It took on ideas from Domain-Driven Design, Team Topologies, and the Architecture Advice Process to develop an Architectural Advice Forum. This led to greater alignment of its software delivery teams, and a coherent technology strategy.

# [Balancing coupling in software design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOM-UrNTS4)

We are used to treating coupling as the necessary evil. Hence, we aim to break systems apart into the smallest services possible, in the ever-lasting quest of decoupling everything. But what results are we getting by following this reasoning? — Instead of the promised land of evolvable systems, many such “decouple everything” endeavors lead straight into the chains of distributed monoliths. Can we do better? What if there is a better way to handle coupling in distributed systems?

One of the useful things about having diagrams like this, when we're thinking about designing systems, is that we can start to look at meaning behind them. Here I've drawn some boxes around related areas and related states. This is where we start to see areas that we could perhaps give to teams, individual ownership

# [DevOps and Cloud InfoQ Trends Report](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cloud-devops-trends-2023/)

Cloud innovation has transitioned from a revolutionary phase to an evolutionary one, focusing on migrating and re-architecting workloads. The cloud space has evolved toward providing on-demand access to scalable resources and managed services, emphasizing simplifying interactions and reducing cognitive load for teams.

# [Building a Flink Self-Serve Platform on Kubernetes at Scale](https://tech.instacart.com/building-a-flink-self-serve-platform-on-kubernetes-at-scale-c11ef19aef10)

At Instacart, we have a number of data pipelines with low-latency needs that handle over two trillion events a year. Those events help our engineering and product teams to make better decisions and gain deeper business insight. In order to leverage those real-time events for our business expansion, we adopted [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) in late 2021 as our real-time distributed processing engine. Flink offers nice features like low latency, high throughput, strong guarantees, state management, and easy replay.

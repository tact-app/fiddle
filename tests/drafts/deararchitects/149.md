Federated GraphQL distributes the ownership of the graph across several teams. This requires all teams to adopt and learn federated GraphQL and can be accomplished by providing a well-rounded ecosystem for developer and schema workflows.

Before you start building custom tools, it helps to use existing tools and resources adopted by the community and gradually work with initial adopters to identify gaps.[![](https://mcusercontent.com/219daa24bb0e9b48aea4bcfcf/images/acaa3125-fecf-4ada-a499-4820211f7e38.jpeg)](https://waswani.medium.com/event-driven-architecture-the-hard-parts-event-payload-bd5cc4809415 "")

An event is generally implemented using the Publish Subscribe pattern. The event is published on an Event Broker Topic which is owned by the publisher, and consumers need to listen to this Topic. The consumers are least interested in who is publishing this event. All they care about is reacting to the event whenever it gets published.

When was the last time you were about to click a button on a website, only to have the page shift—causing you to click the wrong button instead? Or the last time you rage-quit a page that took too long to load?

These problems are only amplified in applications as rich and interactive as ours. The more front-end code is written to support more complex features, the more bytes are sent to the browser to be parsed and executed, and the worse performance can get.

In order to understand the root causes of the environment mess found in most complex enterprises, we need to go through a systematic analysis. This analysis starts from what I believe to be industry consensus around environment strategies. I want to prove by deduction that the industry consensus creates all of the above issues. Based on this we can realise that the industry consensus is wrong and we can build a new and better set of ground rules.

# [The Purpose of Architecture](https://medium.com/system5-dev/the-purpose-of-architecture-ae9552e548d7)

Recently I have been regularly involved in discussions around “the purpose” of architecture. I also repeatedly launched surveys on architecture among engineers and managers as part of our continuous improvement process. Working through it, I realized there is no common understanding of “why?”

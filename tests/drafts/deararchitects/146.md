## Software Architecture

# [Enhancing Your "Definition of Done" Can Improve Your Minimum Viable Architecture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/definition-of-done-mva/)

Software architecture is now a continual flow of decisions that are revisited continuously, and architectural criteria in DoDs have become ephemeral. Software architectures are never "done", but effective automated DoDs can help to improve them with each release.

# [How We Migrated All of Our Premium Subscriptions](https://www.wix.engineering/post/the-great-migration-how-we-migrated-all-of-our-premium-subscriptions)

In this article, I will discuss the journey of this migration, including some of the challenges, lessons learned, and how we leveraged some of the power of “Message Driven Design” in order to achieve our goals.

# Case Study

# [Building and operating a pretty big storage system called S3](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/07/building-and-operating-a-pretty-big-storage-system.html)

I was going to have to change, and really broaden how I thought about software systems and how they behave. This didn’t just mean broadening thinking about software to include those hundreds of microservices that make up S3, it meant broadening to also include all the people who design, build, deploy, and operate all that code.

# Event Storming

# [How we used Event Storming Meetings for enabling Software Domain-Driven Design](https://medium.com/building-inventa/how-we-used-event-storming-meetings-for-enabling-software-domain-driven-design-401e5d708eb)

Incorporating Event Storming meetings into our software engineering process was not a simple or effortless task. However, given the benefits we gained from this approach, we achieved very positive results. It enabled our team to deliver a well-designed service with fewer bugs and more sustainability over the long term.

# Platform Team

# [Interim Platform Team](https://learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev/p/interim-platform-team)

We were working on a B2B2C product, with multiple teams and business units involved. I remember that we had to collaborate with teams outside our business unit, and it caused a lot of interesting dynamics that I aim to explain in this post.

## Software Architecture

# [Architecture Independent Value Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdhFf_I-pRA)

This talk was recorded at Craft Conference 2023. Nick Tune from Empathy Software spoke about the principles, heuristics, and practical techniques that engineers, architects, and leaders can apply to architect their systems as independent value streams.

# Domain-Driven Design

# [Cloud Automation à la DDD](https://architectelevator.com/cloud/ddd-technical-domains/)

Domain modeling isn’t limited to business domains, though. Technical domains, such as modern run-time or cloud architectures provide flexibility and powerful tools but can also burden developers with additional complexity. That’s why such system require expressive modeling of their domain, a task that is too often neglected.

# Case Study

# [A](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/07/building-and-operating-a-pretty-big-storage-system.html) [Journey of Building Efficient Distributed and In-Process Caches at Twitter](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/trends-caches/)

The study and use of cache has a long history, dating back to '60s and '70s. Unlike other areas, such as AI and machine learning, or even databases, there hasn't been huge news in caching. What's new in caching these days? Maybe there's some new eviction algorithms, or maybe there's some new architecture, or maybe there's some new features, or maybe there's some new hardware we can deploy a cache on.

# Event Storming

# [Introduction to Event Storming](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/event-modeling/intro/)

Event Modeling is a simple visual method for designing event-based information systems for the Confluent Streaming Data Platform. Event Modeling engages all stakeholders during the design process in order to reduce implementation costs and risk and to create systems that produce more strategically valuable data during operations.

# [Building a strong knowledge sharing culture on engineering teams](https://swimm.io/blog/software-development-knowledge-sharing-methods-are-broken-heres-why)

Our existing methods for sharing knowledge about software are fundamentally broken, and we need to prioritize sharing this knowledge efficiently and effectively. In this post, I will explain why and what can be done about it.
